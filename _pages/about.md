<p>
I'm the Drew Houston (2005) Career Development Professor at
the MIT
<a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">Sloan School of Management</a>
(in the <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/academic-groups/information-technology/about-us">Information Technology</a> group) and department of
<a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a>.
Before that, I was
a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard
<a href="https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/">Center for Research on Computation and Society (CRCS)</a>,
working with <a href="https://dwork.seas.harvard.edu/">Cynthia Dwork</a>.
I completed my PhD at the Computer
Science department at Cornell University, where I was incredibly
fortunate to be advised by
<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/">Jon Kleinberg</a>.
I received my B.S. in
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from UC Berkeley.
You can find my CV <a href="{{ site.url }}/files/cv.pdf">here</a>.

<p>My primary interests lie in the application of computational
techniques to domains of social concern, including online platforms, algorithmic fairness,
and behavioral economics, with a particular focus on the use of
algorithmic tools in the hiring pipeline. I'm a member of Cornell's
<a href="http://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/">Artificial Intelligence, Policy, and
Practice</a> initiative.
I'm also on the International Advisory Board of <a href="https://saiuniversity.edu.in">Sai University</a> in Chennai.
I coach the <a href="https://thehub.college.harvard.edu/organization/harvard-men-s-soccer-club">Harvard Men's Soccer Club</a>.
In the past, I played club soccer for
for Cornell <a href="https://cornellmundialfc.weebly.com/">Mundial FC</a> and UC Berkeley Men's Club Soccer.
